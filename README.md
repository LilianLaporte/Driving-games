# Driving-games


This repository has been created for the project of the master course "Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Robots" with <a href="https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli/people/person-detail.MjI0MDM0.TGlzdC8yNjg5LDQ4ODg4MTE2Mw==.html">Prof. Emilio Frazzoli</a>. The project's goal is to guide each agent (vehicle) to a designated area by first generating the path, then controlling the agent, and finally avoiding both static obstacles and other agents.
